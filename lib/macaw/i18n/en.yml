  error:
    FileDoesNotExistWithExtensionsList: I''m sorry, but the file ''%{0} %{1}'' does
      not exist. Note that when you provide only the basename (i.e, the filename without
      the extension) or with an unknown extension, arara will try to look for files
      ending with the predefined extensions %{1} in that order. You can override the
      order, the search pattern or even add support for new extensions through the
      configuration file. Please refer to the arara manual to learn more about this
      feature.
    FileDoesNotExist: File ''%{0}'' does not exist.
    CommandNotFound: "\\nI''m sorry, but the command from the ''%{0}'' task could
      not be found. Are you sure the command ''%{1}'' is correct, or even accessible
      from the system path?"
    InvalidYAMLConfigurationFile: 'I''m sorry, but apparently your arara configuration
      file is invalid, that is, it has invalid or missing YAML entries. Unfortunately,
      arara cannot proceed until the error is fixed. I tried my best to dump the error
      message, so here it is:'
    InvalidConfigurationFile: Uh-oh, the configuration file appears to be invalid.
      Are you sure it's a proper YAML file? Unfortunately, arara cannot proceed until
      a proper configuration file is provided.
    InvalidLanguageConfigurationFile: 'Houston, we have a problem. Sadly, the language
      set in the configuration file is not valid. Currently, arara can provide support
      for the following languages: %{0}. Make sure to choose a valid language or remove
      the entry from the configuration file (the field is optional), otherwise arara
      cannot proceed.'
    InvalidFiletypesConfigurationFile: I'm sorry, but it seems your configuration
      file has customized filetypes with neither the extension or pattern defined.
      Both are required in order to continue. Please fix this error in your configuration
      file and try again.
    PathRuntimeErrorConfigurationFile: 'I''''m sorry, but one of the entries of the
      search path in your configuration file has an unavailable variable in the path
      context: ''''%{0}'''''
    PathIOErrorConfigurationFile: I'm sorry, but one of the entries of the search
      path in your configuration file has a malformed directory structure. Could you
      take a look at it?
    InvalidYAMLDirective: 'It appears there is a malformed directive found at line
      %{0}, that is, a directive that might have a YAML syntax error or an invalid
      field. I tried my best to dump the error message, so here it is:'
    DirectiveEmptyCurlyBrackets: Directive ''%{0}'' at line %{1} has empty curly brackets.
      Note that arara opts for a cleaner syntax when a directive has no parameters.
      To fix it, it''s enough to either remove the curly brackets or provide the arguments
      for the directive.
    DirectiveInvalidArgumentList: Directive ''%{0}'' at line %{1} has an invalid argument
      type. The argument ''%{2}'' is a reserved arara keyword and always requires
      a list.
    DirectiveReservedKeyword: Directive ''%{0}'' at line %{1} has an invalid argument
      name. The name ''%{2}'' is a reserved arara keyword representing every element
      in the ''%{3}'' list. Please, pick another name for that argument.
    DirectiveListError: Directive ''%{0}'' at line %{1} has an invalid argument type.
      Only the arguments ''files'' and ''items'' can have a list. Both are reserved
      arara keywords.
    InvalidDirective: Apparently, there''s an invalid directive at line %{0}. Please
      take a look and fix it.
    DirectiveGenericError: Directive ''%{0}'' at line %{1} seems to be malformed.
      It might be a YAML syntax error or a wrong mapping.
    InvalidLanguage: 'I''m sorry, but the language code you chose is invalid. Currently,
      the following languages are supported:'
    RuleNotFound: Uh-oh, I could not find the ''%{0}'' rule in the search path. Could
      you take a look if the rule name is correct and if the rule is accessible through
      the search path?
    InvalidYAMLRule: 'It appears that the ''''%{0}'''' task has a YAML syntax error
      or an invalid field. Could you take a look at the ''''%{0}.yaml'''' file located
      at ''''%{1}''''. I tried my best to dump the error message, so here it is:'
    InvalidRule: Uh-oh, the ''%{0}'' task appears to be invalid. Are you sure the
      ''%{0}.yaml'' file located at ''%{1}'' is a proper YAML file?
    EmptyIdentifierRule: A problem was detected in the ''%{0}'' task. The ''%{0}.yaml''
      file located at ''%{1}'' requires a valid identifier. Could you fix it?
    EmptyNameRule: A problem was detected in the ''%{0}'' task. The ''%{0}.yaml''
      file located at ''%{1}'' requires a valid name. Could you fix it?
    ForbiddenIdentifierRule: Uh-oh, the ''%{0}'' task (referencing the ''%{0}.yaml''
      file located at ''%{1}'') has an invalid argument identifier. ''%{2}'' is a
      reserved keyword, so it cannot be used. Could you use another name?
    EmptyArgumentsListRule: 'A problem was detected in the ''''%{0}'''' task. The
      ''''%{0}.yaml'''' file located at ''''%{1}'''' requires a valid list of arguments.
      Could you fix it? Note that the list of arguments can also be empty, but it
      is still necessary to define it explicitly (with ''''arguments: []'''').'
    WrongIdentifierRule: Uh-oh, the ''%{0}'' task (referencing the ''%{0}.yaml'' file
      located at ''%{1}'') has the wrong identifier - ''%{0}'' was expected, rather
      than ''%{2}''. Could you fix it?
    ArgumentsNotDefinedInRule: 'Oh no, there are arguments used in the diretive ''''%{0}''''
      which are not defined in the ''''%{0}.yaml'''' rule located at ''''%{1}''''.
      You can either remove them from the ''''%{0}'''' directive or add them to the
      list of arguments in the ''''%{0}.yaml'''' rule. Here they are: %{2}'
    DefaultValueRuntimeErrorRule: 'I''''m sorry, but the default value set for the
      argument ''''%{0}'''' of the ''''%{1}'''' task (referencing the ''''%{1}.yaml''''
      file located at ''''%{2}'''') has an unavailable variable/method in the rule
      context: ''''%{3}'''''
    FlagRuntimeErrorRule: 'I''''m sorry, but the flag set for the argument ''''%{0}''''
      of the ''''%{1}'''' task (referencing the ''''%{1}.yaml'''' file located at
      ''''%{2}'''') has an unavailable variable/method in the rule context: ''''%{3}'''''
    DuplicatedCommandElementsRule: Uh-oh, both ''command'' and ''commands'' fields
      are set in the ''%{0}'' task (referencing the ''%{0}.yaml'' file located at
      ''%{1}''). You need to pick only one of them. If your task only relies on a
      single command, you can opt for ''command''; if your rule requires a set of
      commands, maybe the ''commands'' field is more suitable.
    MissingCommandElementsRule: Uh-oh, the ''%{0}'' task (referencing the ''%{0}.yaml''
      file located at ''%{1}'') does not have either the ''command'' or ''commands''
      elements. You need to pick only one of them. If your task only relies on a single
      command, you can opt for ''command''; if your rule requires a set of commands,
      maybe the ''commands'' field is more suitable.
    CommandRuntimeErrorRule: 'I''''m sorry, but the command set for the ''''%{0}''''
      task (referencing the ''''%{0}.yaml'''' file located at ''''%{1}'''') has an
      unavailable variable/method in the rule context: ''''%{2}'''''
    XMLFileNotFound: I''m sorry, but I could not find ''%{0}'' in the current directory.
    XMLBadEncoding: I''m sorry, but apparently ''%{0}'' has a bad encoding. Delete
      the file and try again.
    XMLMalformedFile: I''m sorry, but ''%{0}'' seems to be malformed. Delete the file
      and try again.
    XMLAccess: I''m sorry, but I could not access ''%{0}''. Please check the directory
      permissions and try again.
    ConditionalNotBoolean: 'I''m sorry, but the following conditional does not resolve
      to a boolean value. Please rewrite it and try again:'
    ConditionalRuntimeError: 'I''''m sorry, but one of the conditionals has an unavailable
      variable in the evaluation context: ''''%{0}'''''
